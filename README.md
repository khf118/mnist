# mnist

This is an implementation of a n Layers Neural Network applied on the mnist data ( available here: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ )
For the current configuration we use 3 layers, you can increase or decrease the number of layers by passing a list of layers to the MnistNeuralNetwork constructor.
I used the deskew algorithm using opencv to decrease anomalies and improve performance.
